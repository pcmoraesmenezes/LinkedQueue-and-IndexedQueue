# Queue-and-Stack Repository

This repository contains C++ implementations of a queue and a stack, using linked structures.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to provide simple implementations of queue and stack data structures using linked structures in C++. The code includes functionalities for enqueueing, dequeuing, pushing, and popping elements, along with basic operations to visualize the current state of the data structures.

## Implementation Details

- **Queue:**
  - Enqueue: Add an element to the back of the queue.
  - Dequeue: Remove the element from the front of the queue.

- **Stack:**
  - Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack.

## Usage

To use the programs, follow the instructions provided during runtime. The user interface allows you to interact with the data structures, including inserting, removing, and viewing elements.

## How to Run

Compile the C++ programs using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

```bash
g++ Queue.cpp -o Queue
g++ Stack.cpp -o Stack
```

Run the compiled programs:

```bash
./Queue
./Stack
```

Follow the prompts to interact with the queue and stack.
